# companion-module-microsoft-teams

See HELP.md and LICENSE

The main code is inherited from the companion-module-generic-websocket and then customized for the Microsoft Teams websocket API.

![Button Presets](/buttons_example.png)

Updated for Teams API 2.0.0.
Special thanks to svrooij's update of the API:
https://github.com/svrooij/teams-monitor

Expanded functions to match the updated API.

Note: Toggle-Blur does not cause the Teams API to respond and will not update the state when toggled.
